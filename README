killerApp readme

This AppleScript activates as the screen saver starts, kills all applications and closes all Finder windows. This i neat on display machines in shops and other public machines.
Only foreground processes are killed, so daemons and other background processes are left untouched.

Save this as an application and add it to the login items for ease of use.
